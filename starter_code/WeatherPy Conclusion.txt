WeatherPy Analysis
1.It is noted that Higher temperature is noticed in the cities above the Equator.
The linear regression shows that there is high positive correlation between the maximum temperature and Latitude in the citties in Northern Hemisphere.
Which means as the Latitude increases from Equator, the temperature decreases and as it nears to Equator higher temperatures are experienced.
However, no such conclusion could be gained from the graph between Latitude of cities in Southern Hemisphere and the temperature.
2.There is not enough conclusion to be drawn out of the correlation plotting between Humidity and Latitude of cities in both hemispheres.
Same is with Latitude and cloudiness data and also Latitude and Wind speed data.

Vaction Py Analysis
1.FUrther to the above analysis of the weather conditions in differenet cities of the world, it is time to create a list of hotels where I can visit for my next vacation.So we have used the weather data dataframe and added a heatmap layer on it to to identify the ideal locations.
2.Then we created a new dataframe called cleand data usinf=g the following conditions:- A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 70.I have converted this Farenheit to Celsius.
# Wind speed less than 10 mph.
# Zero cloudiness.
# Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. You want to be sure the weather is ideal.
3.The hotel list ended with 20 hotels from different parts of the world and these are shown in the geo map using markers.
